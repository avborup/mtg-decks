## 🎯 Current Focus
All critical build errors and API type mismatches have been resolved. The application builds successfully with no lint errors. Ready for testing with the backend API server.

## 📝 Notes
- The API server should be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5678` for the client to work properly
- The application supports the deck format already implemented in the Rust API server
- All components use shadcn/ui for consistent styling and accessibility
- TypeScript interfaces match the Rust API structures for type safety

## 🐛 Known Issues
- None currently identified (all build errors and lint issues resolved)

## 🚀 Ready for Testing
The application is now ready for initial testing with the Rust API server.
