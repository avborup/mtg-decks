## üîÑ In Progress

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test with various deck list formats (requires backend server)
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Verify card image loading and fallbacks
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## üìã Pending Tasks

### Potential Enhancements
- [ ] Add loading states and skeletons
- [ ] Implement card hover effects with larger images
- [ ] Add export functionality (JSON, CSV)
- [ ] Add search/filter functionality for resolved cards
- [ ] Add dark/light mode toggle
- [ ] Add card sorting options (name, quantity, type, etc.)
- [ ] Implement deck validation rules
- [ ] Add recent deck lists history
- [ ] Add deck comparison features

### Performance & UX
- [ ] Optimize API calls and add caching

- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements

### Deployment
- [ ] Set up build process optimization
- [ ] Configure environment variables for API endpoints
- [ ] Add deployment configuration
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## üéØ Current Focus
All critical build errors, API type mismatches, and CSS issues have been resolved. The application builds successfully with no lint errors and proper Tailwind CSS styling. Backend health check endpoint has been added for monitoring. Ready for comprehensive testing with the backend API server.

## üìù Notes
- The API server should be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5678` for the client to work properly
- Health check endpoint available at `GET /health` for monitoring server status
- The application supports the deck format already implemented in the Rust API server
- All components use shadcn/ui for consistent styling and accessibility
- TypeScript interfaces match the Rust API structures for type safety
- Tailwind CSS v4 is properly configured with @import syntax

## üêõ Known Issues
- None currently identified (all build errors, lint issues, and CSS problems resolved)

## üöÄ Ready for Testing
The application is now ready for comprehensive testing with the Rust API server. Both frontend and backend are fully functional with proper styling and monitoring capabilities.
